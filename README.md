# Text Editor

## Description

This web application is a feature-rich text editor. It boasts a robust client-server architecture, with an intuitive folder structure. Running `npm run start` initiates the backend and serves the client. Bundling JavaScript files via webpack ensures seamless functionality, while webpack plugins generate essential files like HTML, service worker, and manifest. Leveraging next-gen JavaScript, the editor remains error-free in browsers. It harnesses IndexedDB for immediate database creation, allowing content persistence. Notably, the "Install" button lets users download the app to their desktop. With a registered service worker via workbox, static assets are efficiently pre-cached, guaranteeing optimal performance. Deployment to Heroku is streamlined with proper webpack build scripts.
